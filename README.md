BS2DaisyStem = "Bootstrap Studio to Django, AI System"

## Summary 
Advanced ðŸ‘½ technology.


## Current Development ToDo's:
1. Remove bolding on Qt Designer
2. Fix issue with icons & migrating to PyQt6
3. Fix issue with image subfolder defaulting to Django destination subfolder/static/subfolder; should be static/subfolder
4. Make auto-translations of page links such as /features.html to {% url 'features' %}, so that BSS site templates work right away.

Exports a [Bootstrap Studio](https://bootstrapstudio.io/) design into a [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) project for an exhilerating low-code web design experience.    Allows you to write as much custom/critical code as you would like.

## How it works

This export script will allow you to create custom HTML attributes while developing design with Bootstrap Studio. Those attributes will be convert to their corresponding django template tag inside an export directory.

Finally, export script will move all html/css/js/img generated by Bootstrap Studio to a Django project.

Django is having an application based architecture, create app subfolder and move file inside it. In Boostrap Studio, always create application subfolder inside `Pages`, `Styles`, `JavaScript`,  and `Images` folders.  

If you were to put folders in the root, say Images, then the output will go into DjangoRoot/static/img instead of DjangoRoot/appfolder/static/appfolder/img.  I am not sure why we need to output the subfolder of appfolder under appfolder/static.  That's just the way Django works by default.

The default file placement locations are however, of course, modifiable from the GUI!  See this screenshot:

## Installation

Download the .EXE from the releases section of this page.  Run the EXE and it will give you instructions on the first tab.   These entail essentially, from within BSS:

Go to `Export Options`.

- In `Advanced > Export Script`, specify the **absolute path** of `bss_to_django.exe` on your local machine.
- Enable options `Use a CDN for libraries`, `Use absolute paths`
- Specify `Export destination` as well

`Save` your configuration for later export.
